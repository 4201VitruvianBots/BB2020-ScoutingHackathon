#Main Idea
- Object per team, contain data per game element
- Select alliances based on strengths and weaknesses

##Ideas...
- A search (query) engine
- Class for a game object, score attribute, name attribute, gets extended per year to individual season elements
- Maybe have classes per season instead?

##Data
- Average points/game per team
- Data per specific skill/game element (scouting is about filling in weaknesses in alliance selection)
- Defense
- Rate of mechanical failures

##Representations
- Ranking system (certain criteria)
- Graph

##Game Elements
